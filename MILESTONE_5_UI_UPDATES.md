## Completed UI Updates (2025-09-17)

### Audio Player Controls Refinement
✅ **Playback Controls**
- Implemented FloatingActionButton for play/pause (48px with elevation)
- Added skip forward/backward controls with 30-second intervals
- Increased skip icons from 32px to 40px for visual balance with play button

✅ **Speed & Text Size Controls**
- Created compact speed selector (0.8x-2.0x cycling)
- Reduced button heights from 36px to 32px
- Decreased font size from 12pt to 11pt
- Made text icon smaller (14px from 16px)

✅ **Layout Stability**
- Fixed text size button with 85px container width
- Prevents layout shift when cycling through "Small/Medium/Large/XLarge"
- Centered content within fixed container

✅ **Interactive Elements**
- Added tooltips on all controls with keyboard shortcuts
- Implemented seek bar with time labels
- Added formatted duration display (MM:SS format)

### Keyboard Shortcuts
✅ Spacebar - Play/Pause toggle
✅ Left Arrow - Skip backward 30s
✅ Right Arrow - Skip forward 30s

### Font Size Adjustment Fix
✅ **Dynamic Font Size Updates**
- Added `didUpdateWidget` lifecycle method to detect font size changes
- Updated `shouldRepaint` in CustomPainter to trigger repaints on style changes
- Font size now updates immediately when cycling through Small/Medium/Large/X-Large
- Maintains perfect synchronization with word highlighting during size changes

### Typography Enhancement
✅ **Inter Font Implementation**
- Added Google Fonts package (v6.1.0) dependency
- Implemented Inter font family for all content text
- Applied to both main content and fallback "No content available" text
- Preserves existing font size persistence logic
- Maintains default Medium size for first-time users

## Files Modified
- `lib/screens/enhanced_audio_player_screen.dart`
- `lib/widgets/simplified_dual_level_highlighted_text.dart`
- `pubspec.yaml`

## Technical Implementation Details

### Font Size Fix
- **Problem**: Font size button was cycling correctly but text wasn't updating visually
- **Solution**: Implemented proper widget lifecycle handling to detect and respond to style prop changes
- **Files Changed**:
  - `simplified_dual_level_highlighted_text.dart`: Added `didUpdateWidget` override
  - Updated `shouldRepaint` method to include style comparisons

### Inter Font Integration
- **Approach**: Used Google Fonts package for automatic font downloading and caching
- **Implementation**: Replaced TextStyle with GoogleFonts.inter() throughout content display
- **Benefits**: Improved readability for educational content, consistent typography

### Auto-Scrolling Enhancement
✅ **Smooth Auto-Scroll Implementation**
- Added intelligent viewport-based scrolling that keeps highlighted words visible
- Implements smooth animation with variable duration based on scroll distance
- Maintains word visibility in middle third of viewport for optimal reading experience
- Clamps scroll positions to prevent overshooting at document boundaries
- Scroll duration scales from 200ms (short) to 400ms (long) based on distance

## Next Steps
- Widget tests for player controls (Task 5.21)
- Performance tests for 60fps validation (Task 5.26)
- Integration tests for font size changes and typography
