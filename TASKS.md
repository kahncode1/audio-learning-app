- [x] Align home mini player flush with bottom navigation (2025-09-17)
- [ ] Add proper loading states while audio streams are initializing
- [ ] Implement error recovery for failed audio loads

### Highlighting System Notes (Found 2025-09-17, Updated 2025-09-19)
- [x] Speechify API requires `include_speech_marks: true` flag (documented)
- [x] Character offset alignment handles 0/1-based indexing (implemented)
- [x] Sentence detection uses 350ms pause + punctuation (working)
- [x] Abbreviation detection prevents false sentence breaks (complete)
- [x] Three-layer paint system for optimal performance (implemented)
- [x] LRU cache eviction prevents memory growth (10 doc limit)
- [ ] **Fix highlighting after slider seek** (Found 2025-09-19)
  - Word/sentence highlighting stops working after using slider to seek
  - Position jumps > 10 seconds may lose sync with word indices
  - Need to recalculate current word/sentence after large position changes
- [ ] Consider adding visual indicator when highlighting data unavailable
- [ ] Monitor LRU cache behavior for very long documents (>10k words)

### Future Features - Tap to Play (Planned)
- [ ] **Implement tap-to-play functionality**
  - User taps on any word in the text to jump to that position
  - Audio seeks to tapped word and continues playing
  - Highlighting resumes from tapped position
  - **Data requirements (already available in preprocessing):**
    - ✅ Word character positions (`charStart`, `charEnd`)
    - ✅ Word timing positions (`startMs`, `endMs`)
    - ✅ Character-to-audio mapping for position calculation
  - **Implementation approach:**
    - Detect tap position in text
    - Find word at tap position using character indices
    - Get audio position from word's `startMs`
    - Seek audio player to that position
    - Resume highlighting from that word
