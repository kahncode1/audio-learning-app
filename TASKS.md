# Audio Learning Platform - Development Tasks

## 🎯 CURRENT STATUS: Functionally Complete, Needs Platform Deployment

**App Status:**
- ✅ AWS Cognito authentication fully implemented
- ✅ Offline-first architecture with SQLite
- ✅ All features working in iOS simulator
- ⚠️ Android project structure incomplete
- ❌ Not tested on physical devices
- ❌ Not ready for app store submission

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Android Project Setup Required

### Immediate Action Needed
The Android project is missing critical Gradle files. Must run:
```bash
flutter create . --platforms android
```
This will regenerate the Android project structure without affecting existing code.
