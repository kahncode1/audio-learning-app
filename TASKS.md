## ðŸš€ Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:
- [ ] All tests passing (target: 100%)
- [ ] Sentry configured with DSN
- [ ] Environment variables set
- [ ] iOS build configured
- [ ] Android build configured
- [ ] App Store assets prepared
- [ ] Play Store assets prepared
- [ ] Release notes written

## Notes

- **Test Strategy:** Focus on fixing widget tests first, then add integration tests
- **Monitoring:** Sentry is integrated but needs production DSN configuration
- **Documentation:** README needs update to reflect removal of mock auth
- **Performance:** All targets met, monitoring in place for production validation
