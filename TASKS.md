# Audio Learning Platform - Development Tasks

## 🎯 CURRENT STATUS: Core Features Complete with CDN Infrastructure

**App Status:**
- ✅ AWS Cognito authentication fully implemented
- ✅ Offline-first architecture with SQLite
- ✅ Course download functionality with progress tracking
- ✅ Supabase Storage CDN configured for audio files
- ✅ All features working in iOS simulator
- ✅ Android project structure created
- ⚠️ Audio files need to be uploaded to CDN

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Audio File Upload Required

### Immediate Action Needed
The Supabase Storage CDN is configured but audio files need to be uploaded:
1. Process audio files through ElevenLabs TTS pipeline
2. Upload MP3 files to Supabase Storage using guide at `/preprocessing_pipeline/UPLOAD_TO_SUPABASE.md`
3. Files will be immediately available via CDN for app downloads
