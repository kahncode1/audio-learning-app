Without it, much of what we value doing or having simply wouldn't be possible or attainable without taking on a potentially crippling amount of personal and financial risk.\n\n**The Effect of Insurance**\nSince ancient times, people have pooled their resources and shared losses from the risks they faced. Ancient Chinese traders divided their goods across multiple ships to spread out their risk of losing cargo on treacherous waters. And the Code of Hammurabi, written around 1750 BC, relieved merchants of their debts if their shipments were lost at sea.\n\nThese were some of the earliest forms of insurance. Over time, insurance has evolved into a business that employs millions worldwide, pays hundreds of billions in losses to insured customers each year, and pumps trillions of dollars into the economy.\n\nPart of the challenge industry professionals face in getting the public to fully grasp the societal benefits of insurance is pushing back against common negative public perceptions of the industry that aren't always grounded in reality. These perceptions stem from the intangible nature of insurance—which makes the benefits difficult to recognize unless policyholders receive money for submitted claims.\n\nWe'll explore some common perceptions of insurance and lay out facts that can help strengthen how the industry is viewed.\n\nNow, let's examine some specific examples of how perception differs from reality in the insurance industry.\n\n**Perception versus Reality**\nWhen media outlets report on customers' experiences with insurance, they typically cite the high premiums spent annually per policyholder to maintain required coverages, while also highlighting instances in which policyholders don't \"collect\" on their policies. Less reported is that insurers pay out a significant percentage of every premium dollar collected to insureds and claimants.\n\n**Fueling Negative Perceptions**\nRather than illustrating the many benefits of insurance for individuals, businesses, and society, the media often describe insurance as an expensive product that's rarely used and doesn't provide a value commensurate to its cost.\n\nLet me share several specific perception versus reality comparisons:\nFirst, there's the perception that if you don't have an accident or loss, insurance is a bad investment. The reality is that insurance is a means of protection, not an investment. Without it, policyholders could face financial ruin if their property is destroyed or their activities harm others.\n\nSecond, many people believe that insurance is too expensive. The reality is that compared with paying for losses, it's a bargain. The cost must be put into perspective: Insurance is far less expensive than rebuilding a home, purchasing a new car, replacing lost income, or paying an injured party's medical bills.\n\nThird, there's a perception that insurers keep more premiums for profit than they spend on claims. The reality is that insurers pay roughly 72 cents of each premium dollar for loss and loss adjustment expenses and another 25 cents for other expenses. After taxes and fees, insurers are left with about 1 cent of profit.\n\nA recent example of negative media coverage occurred in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, as companies filed business interruption claims. Media outlets published headlines highlighting claims that were denied:\n\"Insurers Avoid Picking Up Businesses' Covid-19 Pandemic Costs\" from The Wall Street Journal\n\"Insurers are denying coronavirus claims. Restaurants are fighting back\" from CNBC\n\"Businesses Thought They Were Covered for the Pandemic. Insurers Say No.\" from The New York Times\nWhy were the claims denied? Because they didn't stem from physical damage, a requirement for business interruption coverage under many commercial policies.\n\nWhen the media cite the only benefit of insurance as the payment of losses, they minimize the value of its benefits for individuals and society.\n\n**What Do You Know?**\nLet's pause here and consider: Insurance is all about managing risk. But what is risk?\nRisk is the uncertainty of outcomes. Typically, it's used to describe a potential loss and something or someone that's insurable. A risk, as it relates to insurance, only has a chance to result in one of two outcomes: loss or no loss; there is no chance of gain.\n\nFor example, while investing in the stock market can be risky, it's not the type of risk to which insurance applies because financial gain is possible. Insurance is intended only for risks that can result in loss or no loss. So, driving a car is an insurable activity because it can result only in a financial loss or no financial loss.\n\nInsurance is one of many techniques that individuals and businesses use to deal with the risks they face. However, it's often the technique they turn to first. The main benefit of insurance for individuals and businesses is the transfer of some of the financial consequences of a loss away from themselves and to an insurance company.\n\nHere's another important question: What's the concept of pooling, and why is it important to insurance?\nPooling is the grouping together of risks and premiums from many individuals to pay for the losses of a few—thereby spreading the risk among members of a large group. This allows insurers to charge affordable premiums and still pay for large losses.\n\nPooling also helps insurers project losses. The more insureds in the pool, the more predictable losses become, thanks to the law of large numbers.\n\nWhen individuals and businesses have insurance, they know it'll help them return to their pre-loss condition if they experience a loss covered under their policies. In this way, insurance reduces the cost of risk and provides peace of mind to individuals so they can go about their lives and more effectively conduct business.\n\nInsurance also makes individuals and businesses more aware of the risks they face and motivates them to manage those risks by improving safety. For example, manufacturers develop safety features and procedures to minimize property damage and bodily injury to customers and employees. This, in turn, makes it easier for them to obtain affordable insurance.\n\nNow let's look at how insurance transforms potentially catastrophic situations into manageable ones.\n\nImagine that a bonfire spreads and decimates not just one home, but an entire community. Or that a company's product injures hundreds of people, leaving them without the ability to work and care for their families. Without insurance, who could afford to pay for the financial consequences of such situations?\nInsurance transforms what would otherwise be dire circumstances into manageable scenarios. Insurance protects consumers and businesses alike. A typical homeowner, for example, couldn't afford to pay $250,000 to rebuild a home after it burns down and continue to pay the remaining mortgage for the home that no longer exists. As a result, the homeowner would be left on the street without a residence, and the lender would be left with no asset to collect as collateral on the mortgage.\n\nFor this reason, lenders typically won't provide the money needed to purchase a high-value asset unless the asset is insured. Insurance provides the financial backing needed to restore a home and protect the lender's interest in the property.\n\nInsurance also makes it possible to do things such as drive a car or start a business. It protects drivers from potentially large lawsuits if they injure others or damage property. And for business owners, the risk of starting a business would be too great without insurance. For example, without insurance to pay the costs associated with customer injuries stemming from defective products, the financial liability could drive an organization to bankruptcy.\n\nInsurance also pumps large amounts of money into the economy. In the typical insurance transaction, premiums are paid first, and losses are paid later. Because of the lag time between these events, insurers can invest premiums and offer loans to make additional income. This drives economic growth.\n\nBecause of the many benefits it provides, insurance serves as the lubricant that keeps the gears of the economy churning.\n\n**Making Citizens and Society More Resilient**\nThe insurance industry is evolving as a result of two key, overarching factors that are influencing virtually every aspect of the insurance value chain: the growing demand for risk management consulting and new technology that's helping organizations predict and prevent losses.\n\nLet's say the town of Oar's Rest was ravaged by a hurricane. It has a mix of residential communities, small to midsize businesses, public schools, and public utilities. And, thanks to its proximity to the beach, the town also generates a lot of revenue from tourism, with travelers frequently visiting its restaurants and hotels.\n\nInsurance policies will be invaluable to the town's recovery efforts. In addition to having to repair property, citizens will incur expenses for temporary housing, and businesses will experience significant business interruption losses and need to replace their inventory. If individuals, businesses, schools, and utilities don't have the funds to rebuild and recover from their losses, people will leave the area, and the economic vitality and sustainability of the community will be destroyed.\n\nBut with insurance, the town has the means to rebuild and recover. In the wake of both small, individual losses and large-scale disasters, insurers' claims representatives respond with empathy and compassion, acting as quickly as possible to answer customers' questions, investigate losses, and issue claim payments. The injection of funds provided by individual and commercial policies will help the town and its citizens regain their footing and could mean the difference between keeping people and businesses in the community and a mass exodus.\n\n**The Risk Consulting Role**\nThe role of insurers and producers—that's agents and brokers—is expanding. Customers, particularly commercial organizations, no longer want to simply purchase a policy or receive recommendations about coverage. Instead, they want to work with a risk consultant—someone who can provide a customized blend of comprehensive risk management strategies and necessary insurance coverage to help them save money, improve safety, gain a competitive edge, or all of the above.\n\nInsurers who can adopt this consultant role create a rock-solid value proposition, enabling them to forge profitable, long-term customer relationships. To start this process, insurers must gain a holistic understanding of all the variables affecting a customer's goals.\n\n**Assessing a Customer's Risks**\nMany customers, both individuals and organizations, are reevaluating the relationships they have with their insurers, agents, and brokers. Receiving comprehensive coverage at an affordable price is no longer the end goal—it's the table stakes. Along with insurance, customers are looking for a risk management partner who can help them tackle the multitude of risks they face.\n\nThe objective of a risk assessment is to understand a customer's activities. When assessing commercial clients, for example, this involves getting to know the organization's goals, strategy, risks, strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Producers need to devote time to analyzing an organization's property, products, services, employees, and customers to determine appropriate strategies and coverages to incorporate into a comprehensive risk management program.\n\nAs part of this assessment, producers use checklists, surveys, questionnaires, loss histories, property inspections, and industry-specific underwriting or loss control reports. However, the assessment must also include an analysis of things like the customer's competition, regulatory environment, and supply chain.\n\nThroughout the process, producers will want to introduce the customer to various loss control and risk management strategies. Simultaneously, producers should explain available insurance coverage options and the pros and cons of each. At the conclusion of the process, producers should summarize the findings and provide a list of suggested risk management strategies and insurance coverages.\n\n**The Rise of \"Predict and Prevent\"**\nHelping customers manage their risks holistically involves finding ways to not only minimize and pay for losses but also to prevent them.\n\nEnter insurtech and risktech, various forms of technology specifically designed to improve risk management efforts and insurance programs, respectively. They combine smart products, sensors, wireless sensor networks, big data, Internet of Things devices, predictive analytics, and various other forms of data science to anticipate when losses will occur and trigger actions to prevent such losses.\n\nExamples of technology used to predict and prevent losses include:\n**Telematics**\n\n**Wearables**\n\n**IoT sensors**\n\n**Smartphones**\n\n**Cloud storage**\n\n**Predictive models**\n\n**Artificial intelligence**\nThis technology is the foundation of the \"predict and prevent\" mindset that's permeating the insurance value chain. The adoption of this mindset is driven largely by customer demands to reduce insurance premiums and lessen the physical and emotional fallout from losses—even when the financial consequences are transferred to an insurer. As a result of this technological revolution, insurers and insurance professionals are being challenged to adopt more of this technology and use it to fine-tune pricing and coverages, create usage-based insurance, and completely eliminate some loss occurrences.\n\n**Summary**\nWhen you factor in risk, insurance makes much of what we do—from buying a home, to driving a car, to running a business—affordable. It strengthens resiliency for individuals, businesses, and communities when disaster strikes. However, customers want more than coverage from insurers; they seek general risk management support to predict, reduce, and even eliminate future losses.\n\n**Glossary**\nLet me define several key terms we've covered:\nLaw of large numbers: A mathematical principle stating that as the number of similar but independent exposure units increases, the relative accuracy of predictions about future outcomes, or losses, also increases.\n\nSmart product: An innovative item that uses sensors; wireless sensor networks; and data collection, transmission, and analysis to further enable the item to be faster, more useful, or otherwise improved.\n\nSensor: A device that detects and measures stimuli in its environment.\n\nWireless sensor network, or WSN: A wireless network consisting of individual sensors placed at various locations to exchange data.\n\nBig data: Sets of data that are too large to be gathered and analyzed by traditional methods.\n\nInternet of Things, or IoT: A network of objects that transmit data to computers.\n\nPredictive analytics: Statistical and analytical techniques used to develop models that predict future events or behaviors.\n\nData science: An interdisciplinary field involving the design and use of techniques to process very large amounts of data from a variety of sources and to provide knowledge based on the data.\n\nThis concludes our examination of how risk management and insurance work in action to facilitate key societal activities.",
