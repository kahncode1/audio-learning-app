## Notes for Next Session

To continue from Phase 2:
```bash
# Check current error status
flutter analyze 2>&1 | grep -E "error.*test/" | wc -l

# Focus on most common error types
flutter analyze 2>&1 | grep -E "error.*test/" | grep -o "• [^•]*$" | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

# Start with the test file with most errors
flutter analyze 2>&1 | grep -E "error.*test/" | cut -d: -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head
```

Key files to focus on:
- Test files with API mismatches
- Mock service implementations
- Test fixtures and data builders
