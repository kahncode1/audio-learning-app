# Migration History Archive

This directory contains historical documentation from the transition from streaming TTS to download-first architecture.

## Migration Timeline

### September 2025 - Architecture Transition
Successfully migrated from real-time TTS streaming (Speechify/ElevenLabs) to a download-first architecture with pre-processed content.

## Archived Documentation

### Phase Implementation Summaries
- **PHASE_3_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md** - Supabase integration for download infrastructure
- **PHASE_3_TEST_SUMMARY.md** - Testing results for Phase 3
- **PHASE_4_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md** - TTS service removal and code simplification
- **MIGRATION_STATUS.md** - Overall migration tracking
- **CDN_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md** - CDN setup progress

### Milestone Completions
- **MILESTONE_5_UI_UPDATES.md** - UI implementation with visual polish
- **MILESTONE_7_COMPLETION.md** - ElevenLabs integration (later removed)

### Deprecated Guides
- **SPEECHIFY_SSML_GUIDE.md** - SSML formatting for Speechify (no longer used)
- **ELEVENLABS_SETUP.md** - ElevenLabs configuration (no longer used)

## Migration Results

### Benefits Achieved
- **100% cost reduction** - No runtime TTS API calls
- **~40% code reduction** - Removed ~5,000 lines of complex TTS code
- **Instant playback** - Local files with no buffering
- **Full offline capability** - Works without internet after initial download
- **Simplified maintenance** - Pre-processed content eliminates complex algorithms

### Key Changes
- Removed all TTS service dependencies (Speechify, ElevenLabs)
- Replaced with LocalContentService for pre-downloaded files
- Simplified word timing service (no runtime sentence detection)
- Updated audio player to use local MP3 files

## Active Documentation
The current architecture is documented in:
- `/DOWNLOAD_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md` - System design and architecture
- `/DOWNLOAD_APP_DATA_CONFIGURATION.md` - Content preprocessing pipeline
- `/SUPABASE_CDN_SETUP.md` - Backend CDN configuration

## Note
These files are preserved for historical reference and to document the migration journey. The active system no longer uses any TTS streaming services.
