The objective of this lesson is to explain why critical thinking skills are essential in the evolving insurance industry.
Let's begin.
Risk and insurance professionals at all levels make microdecisions all day, every day. Each adds a building block to the foundation of the business and, depending on how well it's made, strengthens or weakens the organization.
For example, claims representatives make seemingly small decisions around how to settle minor claims, but those decisions can add up to big swings in an insurer's loss ratio over time—which, in turn, can affect underwriting strategy, marketing plans, and other decision making throughout the insurance value chain.
So, it's important that decisions are made with a critical eye toward how they will affect every part of an insurer's operation, as well as its customers.
Now, let's consider this question: What are some other examples of microdecisions that could affect an entire organization?
These decisions can have far-reaching effects across the insurance value chain:

Determining the appropriate coverage limits for an individual policy
Choosing whether to have a prospective customer elaborate on information provided in an insurance application
Deciding what data to include in a predictive model and where it should come from
Determining whether a claim shows signs of fraud and should be reported to the special investigation unit
Deciding the best way to respond empathetically to a customer's claim
Determining how to describe your ideal job candidate for an open position to a recruiter or hiring manager

At an insurer, nothing is performed in a vacuum. Each activity is closely linked to other activities or functional areas within the organization. So to make sound business decisions, risk and insurance professionals must think critically, be familiar with various insurer functions, and understand how their decisions will affect those functions, the individuals performing them, and customers. This is key to effective leadership.
When every area of the organization is involved and considered in the decision-making process, it allows for better decisions to be made based on better information. In addition, it allows stakeholders to challenge assumptions and conclusions. This embodiment of the critical thinking process ultimately yields a more comprehensive solution. It's also an image of the type of informed decision-making that has helped insurers evolve and overcome various challenges throughout their existence.
Now, let's examine some of the challenges faced by insurers and the responses industry leaders have developed to overcome them. These scenarios highlight the benefits of building yourself into a good decision maker by using critical thinking and having a holistic view of the insurance value chain.
The Liability Crisis
The challenge began in the mid-1980s with a rapid increase in tort litigation and class-action lawsuits that resulted in large settlements, leading to large losses on liability policies. Some of the largest losses came from asbestos, environmental, and health risks that had been written long before claims were filed. The large losses triggered insolvencies, a drastic increase in liability premiums, and a similarly dramatic reduction in available coverage.
This made it difficult or impossible for some organizations to obtain liability coverage, thus limiting their ability to provide certain offerings, particularly in the areas of medical and social services.
Here's an important question to consider: What's the difference between occurrence and claims-made coverage?
Under an occurrence policy, coverage is triggered for losses that happen within the policy period, even if the policy has expired. Under a claims-made policy, coverage is triggered for claims that occur after the policy's coverage began—the retroactive date—and are reported within the policy's reporting period.
Why is this distinction so important? Prior to the 1980s, liability coverage was primarily written on an occurrence basis. So, if a doctor's medical malpractice in 1984 harmed a child but that harm wasn't discovered until 1999, the liability policy that was in place in 1984 would cover the loss—even if it had expired in 1985.
Claims-made policies, on the other hand, will only provide coverage for claims made during a defined reporting period, such as 12 or 16 months, thus limiting an insurer's long-term exposure to liability claims.
The insurers' response to the liability crisis included several key strategies:

Change liability coverage from an occurrence to a claims-made basis
Revise underwriting guidelines
Expand exclusions
Lower single claim limits and establish general aggregate limits
Promote risk management methods, such as large deductibles, captive insurance, and risk retention groups
Lobby for tort reforms, such as caps on noneconomic and punitive damages

The Threat of Terrorism
Fast forward to September 11, 2001. Terrorist attacks in New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia caused massive loss of life and property damage in the United States. The sudden, unexpected, and catastrophic events of that day resulted in enormous financial consequences, many of which were borne by the insurance industry. What has since become known simply as 9/11 remains one of the largest single insured loss events in history.
The 9/11 attacks resulted in large claims being filed across multiple lines and types of coverage that previously seemed unrelated and disconnected, such as property, liability, business interruption, workers compensation, aviation, and life insurance. And many claims came from areas outside of New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia due to the far-reaching airline and event cancellations that followed.
As a result, insurers added terrorism exclusions to nearly all commercial policies, leaving organizations with critical coverage gaps. Reinsurers were also hesitant to insure loss exposures in areas deemed vulnerable to attack.
Consider this question: Why are acts of terrorism inherently catastrophic?
Acts of terrorism are inherently catastrophic because they are unpredictable and the perpetrators intend to cause widespread death, injury, property loss, or economic loss by exploiting targets that are not well protected from attack.
Acts of terrorism can create, whether directly or indirectly, loss exposures related to property, business interruption, reputational harm, and employee illness and injury. Additionally, significant liability loss exposures can stem from an organization's response, or lack thereof, to a terrorism threat.
The insurers' response to the threat of terrorism involved several approaches:

Collaborate with the federal government to share the cost of terrorism-related losses via the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, known as TRIA
Develop stand-alone terrorism policies for high-risk exposures
Define "act of terrorism" to clearly delineate what is and isn't covered
Improve assessment of and underwriting for risk correlation and aggregation

Social Inflation
The challenge of social inflation affects liability losses, which have been steadily increasing—particularly among commercial auto, products liability, professional liability, and directors and officers policies. Premiums are also increasing as a result, making liability coverage less affordable.
What exactly is social inflation? Social inflation is the rising cost of insurance claims due to an increase in the number and size of nuclear jury verdicts—driven by juries' increasing distrust of corporate entities and a desire to punish them for injuries to consumers—longer legal proceedings, and an increase in tort litigation and class actions, further perpetuated by an increase in third-party litigation funding.
The insurers' response to social inflation includes:

Revise underwriting guidelines and claims procedures associated with commercial liability risks
Minimize loss exposures in areas known for juries that seek outsized verdicts for plaintiffs
Raise public awareness of the effect of social inflation on policyholders
Promote corporate social responsibility and public relations campaigns to counteract anti-corporate sentiment

Let's address a common perception versus reality regarding insurance fraud.
The perception is that "Insurance fraud is a victimeless crime."
The reality is quite different. As with large jury verdicts, some believe fraud only hurts insurers. But it's estimated that non-health insurance fraud costs the industry tens of billions annually, which trickles down to consumers through annual premium increases.
Rapid Growth of E-Commerce
The challenge here was significant. The rapid growth of the internet dramatically changed customers' expectations, forcing companies in one of the most traditional and conservative industries to rapidly adapt or lose ground to those that did.
What's more, customers' demands for instant access to information and self-service tools threatened to upend how insurance was sold and the role of the agent and broker in the purchasing process.
The insurers' response to the growth of e-commerce included:

Transform marketing and claims functions via websites and apps
Create self-service tools that make it easier for customers to obtain quotes, submit claims, ask questions, and customize coverage
Reduce dependency on manual and paper processes
Capture and analyze customer data to create more personalized products, marketing messaging, and customer service
Direct agents and brokers to offer more risk consulting and client advisory services
Enhance fraud detection through data mining and analysis

Another perception versus reality worth examining:
The perception is that "Insurers can only compete on price."
The reality shows there are numerous ways insurers can strengthen their competitive advantage. For example, insurers can differentiate themselves through their web- and app-based self-service tools; predictive analytics; risk management and loss control strategies; and the quality of their customer and claims services.
Climate Change
The challenge of climate change presents unique difficulties. Weather pattern shifts resulting from climate change dramatically deviate from historical data used to determine how likely a weather-related loss is to occur and what the severity of the loss is likely to be.
This results in insurers being exposed to more frequent and severe losses than they anticipated when they issued policies—which, naturally, increases claims costs. It also calls for dramatic changes to how insurers predict and analyze weather-related exposures, such as windstorm, wildfire, drought, excessive heat, freezing temperatures, snow, hail, rain, and flood.
The insurers' response to climate change has been comprehensive:

Recalibrate predictive models to add more weight to recent events
Supplement historical data with more forward-looking data related to sea-level rise, river flow, shoreline erosion, temperature, and natural catastrophes
Advocate building code updates to enhance property resiliency
Improve assessment of and underwriting for concentrations of risks
Revise reinsurance strategies to offset financial ramifications of loss
Reexamine property risk underwriting
Embrace parametric coverage solutions
Obtain access to alternative sources of capital through investment markets

Coronavirus Pandemic
In addition to the nearly incalculable toll COVID-19 has had on human life, the virus ground nearly all but the most essential businesses to a halt, kept people confined to their homes—dramatically reducing miles driven—reshaped the way employees think about work-life balance, triggered numerous business interruption claims, and threatened the reputation of the insurance industry due to the widespread denial of business interruption claims.
The coronavirus pandemic is often referred to as a "black swan" event. What is such an event? A black swan event is a highly unlikely and or unpredictable event that has severe and or far-reaching consequences.
At a time when citizens were reeling from the threat of a life-threatening illness, the loss of loved ones, business closures, and general uncertainty about the future, insurers had to try to preserve their reputations, defend their position on business interruption claims, remain empathetic to policyholders, and manage a workforce that suddenly had to perform most of its work from home.
The insurers' response to the coronavirus pandemic involved:

Revise policy wording to clarify when business interruption and business income coverage would apply
Identify and quantify the risk of "black swan" events
Issue premium rebates to auto insureds commensurate with their reduction in risk
Revise homeowners and auto coverages to accommodate risks associated with the rise in home- and ride-sharing activities
Redefine traditions and guidelines related to insurer workplace culture

Let's examine one final perception versus reality:
The perception is that "Insurers are incapable of or slow to change. They're too 'old school,' stuck in their ways, or traditional."
The reality tells a different story. Sure, some insurers trace their lineage back hundreds of years and struggle to update legacy systems. But they still manage to be great innovators, as demonstrated by their ability to overcome adversity stemming from things such as increasing liability litigation, climate change, and COVID-19.
Summary
As insurance professionals face new challenges in the ever-evolving insurance industry, it's important that they use critical thinking and have a holistic view of the insurance value chain to tackle those challenges and guide their everyday business decisions.
The insurance industry has faced numerous challenges over the years, requiring critical thinking and adaptation to overcome them. Some key examples include:

The liability crisis of the 1980s led to the development of claims-made policies to limit long-term exposure.
After 9/11, insurers worked with the government to create terrorism insurance programs and improved catastrophe modeling.
Social inflation has led insurers to focus more on loss control, alternative dispute resolution, and policy language clarity.
The growth of e-commerce pushed insurers to develop online tools and adapt distribution models.
Climate change is driving improvements in catastrophe modeling and a focus on resilience and sustainability.
The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digital transformation and highlighted the need for pandemic insurance solutions.

Throughout these challenges, critical thinking and a holistic view of the insurance value chain have been essential for insurers to adapt and thrive in an evolving industry. Insurance professionals must continue applying these skills to tackle future challenges.
